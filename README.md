# A-Web-Application-on-Forecasting-the-Bitcoin-Prices-of-Next-day-using-ML
We  analyzed several machine learning  models like Linear Regression on our time series dataset of Bitcoin to find the best-predicted model and made an easy-to-use interface where users can input price data and obtain predictions instantly.
## Objectives
* Develop a web application to predict the following day's Bitcoin prices using machine learning.
* Train Linear Regression models on historical Bitcoin data for "Close," "Open," "High," and "Low" price datasets.
* Allow users to input price values through a form and obtain real-time predictions via the web application.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, MAPE, SMAPE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
## Findings
* User-Friendly Interface for Bitcoin Prices Forecasting.
* Efficient Integration of Machine Learning Models.
## Future enhancement
* We would like to consider other cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano) to conduct this experiment on. 
* Our next target is to apply the most efficient model.
## Conclusion
This work on Cryptocurrency price prediction is highly usable for investors to enter into or exit from the market. It enables them to make more informed decisions about the future of the digital asset market.
